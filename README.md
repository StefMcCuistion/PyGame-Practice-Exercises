## Virtual Environments
Virtual Environments will keep you from installing dependencies and packages globally
There are many tools you can use like ``pipx`` and ``poetry`` to assist with this, but for an out-of-the-box solution ``venv`` comes with Python.
The command ``python -m venv .venv`` will create a virtual environment in the ``.venv`` folder. (Do this at the root)
Then the command ``source ./venv/Scripts/Activate`` will activate the environment, and any console commands you enter afterwards will affect the virtual environment.
Such as the command to install requirements from a ``requirements.txt`` file: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
